--- ABOUT ME TEXT

About Me:

<p style="width: 600px;"><small> 
    <b>Hey There! ðŸ‘‹</b>
    <br>
    I'm James, and I'm a technical content developer currently based in SoCal. The simple TL;DR is: I am a problem-solver, I love learning new things,  and I am absolutely driven to helping others.
    <br>
    <br>
    As much as I enjoy building software, I realized I took deep satisfaction when I could help others understand or see the value in something â€” anything it may be â€” that they could immediately apply in their work or personal lives. 
    <br>
    <br>
    During my free time, I love to be outdoors and enjoy backpacking, camping, snowboarding (you name it!). My most recent trip was to Mt. Whitney and exploring many of the beautiful sections of the JMT.
    <br>
    <br> 
    Feel free to connect with me through any of the channels below.
    <br>
    <br> 
    <b>Background:</b>
    <br>
    B.S. in Computer Science, <i>cum laude</i> & M.A. in Education Technology.
